**Test Automation in the ”Microservice” Oriented Enterprise**

*Abstract*

> Our industry has seen a shift for service-based architectures towards a smaller, more focused concept of “micro-services”. A benefit of this approach is to treat each microservice as a separate application that can be independently deployed, scaled, and maintained. These new system boundaries can increase testing complexity and must be managed effectively. In this talk we:

> * introduce microservice terminology
> * discuss some approaches to managing the testing of these loosely coupled but still interdependent systems
> * demonstrate service based testing techniques
